## Setup Environment

For this project, we used python 3.8.5. We recommend setting up a new virtual
environment:

```shell
python -m venv ~/venv/daformer
source ~/venv/daformer/bin/activate
```

In that environment, the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

Further, please download the MiT weights and a pretrained DAFormer using the
following script. If problems occur with the automatic download, please follow
the instructions for a manual download within the script.

```shell
sh tools/download_checkpoints.sh
```

All experiments were executed on a NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti.

## Inference Demo

Already as this point, the provided DAFormer model (downloaded by
`tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be applied to a demo image:

```shell
python -m demo.image_demo demo/demo.png work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c.json work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/latest.pth
```

When judging the predictions, please keep in mind that DAFormer had no access
to real-world labels during the training.

## Setup Datasets

**Cityscapes:** Please, download leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip and
gt_trainvaltest.zip from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/)
and extract them to `data/cityscapes`.

**GTA:** Please, download all image and label packages from
[here](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) and extract
them to `data/gta`.

**Synthia (Optional):** Please, download SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES from
[here](http://synthia-dataset.net/downloads/) and extract it to `data/synthia`.

**ACDC (Optional):** Please, download rgb_anon_trainvaltest.zip and
gt_trainval.zip from [here](https://acdc.vision.ee.ethz.ch/download) and
extract them to `data/acdc`. Further, please restructure the folders from
`condition/split/sequence/` to `split/` using the following commands:

```shell
rsync -a data/acdc/rgb_anon/*/train/*/* data/acdc/rgb_anon/train/
rsync -a data/acdc/rgb_anon/*/val/*/* data/acdc/rgb_anon/val/
rsync -a data/acdc/gt/*/train/*/*_labelTrainIds.png data/acdc/gt/train/
rsync -a data/acdc/gt/*/val/*/*_labelTrainIds.png data/acdc/gt/val/
```

**Dark Zurich (Optional):** Please, download the Dark_Zurich_train_anon.zip
and Dark_Zurich_val_anon.zip from
[here](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/publications/2019/GCMA_UIoU/) and extract it
to `data/dark_zurich`.

The final folder structure should look like this:

```none

│   │   ├── gt
│   │   │   ├── train

```

**Data Preprocessing:** Finally, please run the following scripts to convert the label IDs to the
train IDs and to generate the class index for RCS:

```shell
python tools/convert_datasets/gta.py data/gta --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/cityscapes.py data/cityscapes --nproc 8
python tools/convert_datasets/synthia.py data/synthia/ --nproc 8
```

## Training

For convenience, we provide an [annotated config file](configs/daformer/gta2cs_uda_warm_fdthings_rcs_croppl_a999_daformer_mitb5_s0.py) of the final DAFormer.
A training job can be launched using:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/daformer/gta2cs_uda_warm_fdthings_rcs_croppl_a999_daformer_mitb5_s0.py
```

For the experiments in our paper (e.g. network architecture comparison,
component ablations, ...), we use a system to automatically generate
and train the configs:

```shell
python run_experiments.py --exp <ID>
```

More information about the available experiments and their assigned IDs, can be
found in [experiments.py](experiments.py). The generated configs will be stored
in `configs/generated/`.

## Testing & Predictions

The provided DAFormer checkpoint trained on GTA→Cityscapes
(already downloaded by `tools/download_checkpoints.sh`) can be tested on the
Cityscapes validation set using:

```shell
sh test.sh work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c
```

The predictions are saved for inspection to
`work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/preds`
and the mIoU of the model is printed to the console. The provided checkpoint
should achieve 68.85 mIoU. Refer to the end of
`work_dirs/211108_1622_gta2cs_daformer_s0_7f24c/20211108_164105.log` for
more information such as the class-wise IoU.

Similarly, also other models can be tested after the training has finished:

```shell
sh test.sh path/to/checkpoint_directory
```

When evaluating a model trained on Synthia→Cityscapes, please note that the
evaluation script calculates the mIoU for all 19 Cityscapes classes. However,
Synthia contains only labels for 16 of these classes. Therefore, it is a common
practice in UDA to report the mIoU for Synthia→Cityscapes only on these 16
classes. As the Iou for the 3 missing classes is 0, you can do the conversion
mIoU16 = mIoU19 * 19 / 16.

The results for Cityscapes→ACDC and Cityscapes→DarkZurich are reported on
the test split of the target dataset. To generate the predictions for the test
set, please run:

```shell
python -m tools.test path/to/config_file path/to/checkpoint_file --test-set --format-only --eval-option imgfile_prefix=labelTrainIds to_label_id=False
```

The predictions can be submitted to the public evaluation server of the
respective dataset to obtain the test score.


The checkpoints come with the training logs. Please note that:

* The logs provide the mIoU for 19 classes. For Synthia→Cityscapes, it is
  necessary to convert the mIoU to the 16 valid classes. Please, read the
  section above for converting the mIoU.
* The logs provide the mIoU on the validation set. For Cityscapes→ACDC and
  Cityscapes→DarkZurich the results reported in the paper are calculated on the
  test split. For DarkZurich, the performance significantly differs between
  validation and test split. Please, read the section above on how to obtain
  the test mIoU.
